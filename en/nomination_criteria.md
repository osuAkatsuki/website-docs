# Nomination Process
Maps that are currently submitted on [official server](https://osu.ppy.sh) but don't have any nomination statuses can receive custom ones on Akatsuki. If a player is interested in having a map go through an evaluation process, they must send it to their respective mode in the Nomination Request category on [Discord](https://akatsuki.gg/discord):

- `#nomination-std`: Available for osu! [standard](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/en/Game_mode/osu!) maps;
- `#nomination-taiko`: Available for osu! [taiko](https://osu.ppy.shwiki/en/Game_mode/osu!taiko) maps;
- `#nomination-ctb`: Available for osu! [catch the beat](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/en/Game_mode/osu!catch) maps;
- `#nomination-mania`: Available for osu! [mania](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/en/Game_mode/osu!mania) maps;

Once the map set is sent and a Beatmap Nominator is available, they will decide whether the map is worth being **Ranked**, **Loved**, or should remain **Unranked**. If a player is not satisfied about a mapset’s given status, or would like to report one that doesn’t follow the current criteria that has been given a status by mistake, they must forward it to the `#rank-discussion` channel.

# Nomination Statuses
Here are the currently available nomination status on the server, with their respective purpose:

- **Ranked**: Ranked beatmaps use the **double upwards chevron icon** in the song selection screen. They allow players to compete on leaderboards and gain performance points from setting scores. This status is applied by either the Beatmap Nomination team, or the official server.
- **Approved**: Approved beatmaps use the **check mark icon** in the song selection screen. They're part of an old nomination system used by the official server, and allow players to compete on leaderboards and gain performance points from setting scores. This status can only be applied by the official server.
- **Qualified**: Qualified beatmaps use the **check mark icon** in the song selection screen. They enter a queue, and will eventually be Ranked if they aren't disqualified from it. On Akatsuki, once a map is moved from **Qualified** to **Ranked**, the scores submitted within the qualification period remain. This status is currently only applied by the official server.
- **Loved**: Loved beatmaps use the **heart icon** in the song selection screen. Unlike Ranked beatmaps, they do not award performance points from setting scores. This status is applied by either the Beatmap Nomination team, or the official server.
- **Unranked**: Unranked beatmaps use the **question mark icon** in the song selection screen. They don’t offer any leaderboards nor allow the player to gain any performance points from setting scores, their only benefit is to increment a player’s total score. This is the default given status for beatmaps.

## Note on current Ranked-Section
Due to historical events, the current ranked-section of Akatsuki contains maps that do not meet these ranking criteria but are still present. These maps are considered temporary exceptions until the Ranked-Section has been thoroughly reviewed and cleaned up.
